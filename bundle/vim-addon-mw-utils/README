* cached file contents
  get some information from files and cache the result.
  Reparse the file when it has changed automatically.

* tiny-cmd : Never get the "Press ENTER or type command to continue"
   message again

* funcref:
  - poor man's closures for Vim.
  - Create function objects calling autoload function without sourcing that file
  - (be lazy, do the work when it has to be done)
  - get rid of the "Use upper case letters for custom functions" annoyance

   Example:
  let myFun = funcref#Function("return ARGS[0]")
  let result = funcref#Call(myFun, [2])

  let myFun2 =  funcref#Function("foo#bar#Baz")
  
  " pass arguments (kind of simple closure):
  let myFun2 =  funcref#Function("return ARGS", {args: [1]} )
  echo funcref#Call(myFun, [2])

  echoes [1,2]

  " bind function to an object:
  let myFun2 =  funcref#Function("return SELF.myvalue", {self: {"a": "myvalue"} } )

etc..

This library is used by many of my plugins
